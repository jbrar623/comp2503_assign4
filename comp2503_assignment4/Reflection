Reflection: 

Working with built-in data structures from the Java Collections Framework, 
specifically HashMap and TreeMap, was a very different experience from implementing 
our data structures in assignments 1–3. In assignments 1–3, I felt it was difficult 
to distribute the work and implement the data structures as a group, as we all had 
different coding styles, levels of understanding, and time commitments. Using the 
built-in data structures in Assignment 4 helped make the code more streamlined and 
less complex compared to our manual implementations. I had some issues figuring out 
and understanding using the comparator as a parameter in the tree map constructor, but 
after researching and asking questions, I understood how TreeMaps store values and use 
given keys to find those values.

When using linked lists and binary search trees, making sure our classes were 
functioning to the entire required capacity was slightly demanding, as there were many 
classes and components required that sometimes had issues. A benefit of this, however, 
was that we could implement any methods we felt necessary and override existing methods 
to serve our needs. While we can still do this with hashmaps and tree maps, it was easier 
with our own generic classes, such as BST and SLL. One of the aspects of the assignment 
that I came to appreciate after completing assignment 4 was the concept of custom 
comparators, which we created. Overall, while some aspects of the assignments were 
hallenging, I enjoyed implementing this Avenger data analysis program and 
appreciated the benefits and limitations of each data structure.
